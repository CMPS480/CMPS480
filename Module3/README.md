Module 3: Building a Prototype: The Front End

Project3

For this module, complete the following:

Create a functional (working) interface.
Implement all agreed upon use cases.
Create one or multiple HTML pages.
Add styling with CSS.
Add interactivity with JavaScript.
Simulate interaction with the server (hard code JSON responses).
The interface should be minimal because you only have a week.
If necessary, simplify.
Once you are done, submit the following:

A link to a live version of the project for the this module.
A link to the GitHub repository of the project for the this module.
Any concerns you have about the project at this.
Note that you should include a brief summary of your contributions under Communication and Research.
Make sure none of the parts of your submission change and keep working. For example, you may want to create a separate branch in GitHub and have a different URL in your jail for each module.
