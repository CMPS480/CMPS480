# Module 1: Business Model Canvas

## Project 1

For this module, we need to complete the following:

1. Set up a common **Slack channel** for the team. Invite the instructor.
2. Create a common **GitHub repository** for the team. Invite the instructor.
3. **Pick a team leader**. The team leader is should contact the instructor when there are problems.
4. Several options for ideas are usually offered by the instructor, though you can propose your own if you want. But the selected idea has to be approved by the instructor.
5. Complete a **first version of the business model canvas** for your idea (it is expected to change). Commit it to the GitHub repository.
6. **Set up your jail** so that you each of you can run the projects on your own.
7. Create you **own GitHub branch** from which you work. Then create pull requests to merge into master. Do this at least once for the first module, to make sure you are ready for the upcoming modules.

Once you are done, submit the following:

1. A link to a live version of the project for the this module.
2. A link to the GitHub repository of the project for the this module.
3. Any concerns you have about the project at this.

Note that you should include a brief summary of your contributions under Communication and Research.
Make sure none of the parts of your submission change and keep working. For example, you may want to create a separate branch in GitHub and have a different URL in your jail for each module.
