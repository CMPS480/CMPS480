For this module, complete the following:

Each student in the group should develop at least one detailed use case.
Create a box-and-line diagram to display the software architecture. The boxes are the components and must include front end, back end, and a database (mention specific technologies that you will be using). The lines represent interactions and you should include some details.
Each use case should be supported by the API. Create a simple first version that shows the URL, the input JSON, and the output JSON. You must include examples.
Create a security document in which you answer at least the following questions:
How do you make sure the system is secure and data safe?
What data is sensitive? (see here)
How will you protect it?
What specific technologies will you use for protection? E.g., HTTPS.
Once you are done, submit the following:

A link to a live version of the project for the this module.
A link to the GitHub repository of the project for the this module.
Any concerns you have about the project at this.
Note that you should include a brief summary of your contributions under Communication and Research.
Make sure none of the parts of your submission change and keep working. For example, you may want to create a separate branch in GitHub and have a different URL in your jail for each module.
